# Pon-Go
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A pong style game but with power ups and debuffs.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will create a Pong game that will occasionally put little spheres in the middle of the play space that you must hit in order to get either a power up, or a debuff that strengthens the A.I. The goal is to see how long you can last against the A.I or to win.


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A fully playable version of the Pong-style game with functional A.I.
Power up and debuff spheres that appear in the same place and affect gameplay.
Score tracking
Win/Loss Condition system.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Randomized spawning of power-ups and debuffs.
Improved A.I that reacts more dynamically to the player’s movements.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All events are completely randomized with multiple unique effects.
A fully functional effects system that shows what effect you have currently.
ASCII style art for the game space and aesthetics
Difficulty ramp

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are to finish the core game loop with paddle and ball movement, along with a working AI opponent. Then I’ll add the power up and debuff system, doing my best to make them appear randomly and affect gameplay. I’ll have to research how to track effects and how to create a status system. The ASCII art should be relatively simple to add. Then I’ll buffer out any glitches or bugs in the code to create a well polished game.
